# Lesson 1 Homework

This weeks homework consists of two programs and some practice questions.

1. Tip Calculator
2. GPA Calculator (optional)
3. Practice Questions

My suggestions to you of how to create these programs can be found in
tip_calculator.py and gpa_calculator.py. These contain the basic
[algorithms](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/algorithm) I would follow
if I were creating these programs.

I have provided a sample program (basics.py) to provide you a template of how
your program should be. You are free to copy portions of my code to use in your
program but I highly encourage you to fully understand what it is doing first.
